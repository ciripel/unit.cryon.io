# [XEROM](https://xerom.org/)

*Xerom is a rapid development chain where node improvements (and other proposed changes) will be production tested before being rolled into Ether-1. Both chains will work with and support the global ethoFS network of redundant content delivery nodes. Xerom will deliver additional robustness to the underlying file replication and delivery, on a separate blockchain, providing fault tolerance and performance benefits. Most importantly perhaps, Xerom delivers development process agility.*
